# Multiply Robust Estimation

This software package implements the multiply robust method proposed in the paper "Multiply Robust Estimation for Local Distribution Shifts with Multiple Domains".

* estimators: implement the multiply robust estimation method
* utils: implement utility functions including data preprocessing and segment clustering algorithms
* weights: implement different importance weighting methods to adjust for covariate shifts and label shifts
